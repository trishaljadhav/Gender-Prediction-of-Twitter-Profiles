# Gender Prediction of Twitter Profiles
Used description of Twitter profiles to build a Machine Learning model to predict gender of the user. Performed EDA on the data to spot trends and built a function to clean text data before vectorizing it. Deployed Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes and XGBoost for classification. Concluded from EDA and performance of models that twitter profiles have shifted away from gender stereotypes, allowing for more individual expression.
